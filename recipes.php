        I love to use facial masks. These are two of my favorites. They are fabulous for moisturizing skin and sloughing dead skin cells. Some people will notice a slight reddening of the skin for a few hours after a facial. Complete your facial the night before a special occasion for a glowing, natural look the next day.

        <span class="ptext-bold">Ingredients: Facial Mask #1</span>
        <br> 2T Bentonite or French Green Clay
        <br> 2T Organic Ground or Whole Oats
        <br> 1 egg yolk (mature skin) or 1 egg white (under 30 or oily skin)
        <br> 6 drops of Rejuvenation (see recipe above)
        <br> 2T jojoba oil to make thin paste

        <span class="ptext-bold">Ingredients: Facial Mask #2:</span>
        <br> 2 T Bentonite or French Green Clay
        <br> 1 T Honey
        <br> ½ t Whole Milk or Cream
        <br> ½ banana

        <span class="ptext-bold">Directions:</span>
        <br> Combine other ingredients and add enough Jojoba or milk to make a thin paste that is not runny. Place wet mask on face and leave until dry and firm (5 – 15 minutes). Gently wash face. Do not get clay in the sink as it is will clog drains (experience speaks loudly here!) Use a small bowl of warm water to rinse off skin and discard the clay water outside.
        <br>
        <br> Afterwards, apply 6 drops of any combination of these essential oils: Frankincense, Orange, Lavender, Palma Rosa, Rose Geranium or Rose Hip Seed oil. Put in ½ teaspoon of jojoba, apricot kernel, almond or sesame oil and apply to face.

          <span class="ptext-bold">Healthy Feet: a recipe for Athlete’s Foot and Plantar Warts</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          Tea Tree and Lavender make this blend a wondrous aid for stubborn Athlete’s foot and other fungi, as well as plantar warts.  Apply to clean and dry feet morning and night.<br><br>

          <span class="ptext-bold">Ingredients:</span><br>
          10 drops Tea tree<br>
          10 drops Lavender<br>
          3 drops Lemon<br>
          ½ teaspoon Olive or Jojoba oil<br><br>

          Application for Plantar Warts:  Scrub the plantar warts down to clear white skin using a file or pumice stone (the darkened head will fall off when completely scrubbed and there will be a little hole).  It may take multiple scrubbings to reach this stage.  Apply Healthy Feet to the wart and cover it with a Band-Aid to keep clean.  Scrub with the pumice stone and use Healthy Feet morning and night until the tissue has grown back completely.  Avoid sweaty feet, dirty socks and public locker rooms while healing.<br><br>

          It is important to remove all of the wart and cover.  Plantar warts create a callous-like cover and then root out and multiply.  Apply this mixture until the skin is clear.  Consistency is the key to success!<br><br><br>

          <span class="ptext-bold">Healthy Footbath:</span><br><br>
          Treat yourself to a regular footbath and prevent feet fungus or infections from taking hold.  It is soothing and enjoyable.  Fill a foot sized plastic tub with hot water.  Add one of the following recipes:<br><br>

          4 drops Lavender<br>
          2 drops Lemon<br>
          1 drop Rosemary<br>
          &nbsp; -- or --<br>
          4 drops Lavender<br>
          2 drops Tea tree<br><br>

          Soak your feet until the water is cool and towel dry.  Apply Healthy Feet if needed.<br>

        Ingredients:
        <br>
      </p>

      <p class="ptext">
        ¼ cup Organic Sesame seed oil
        <br> ¼ cup Organic Olive oil cold pressed
        <br> 30 drops Prickly Pear
        <br> 20 drops Moringa
        <br> 20 drops Cucumber oil
        <br> 30 drops Bitter Orange
        <br> 8 drops Geranium
        <br> 8 drops Bulgarian Lavender

      </p>

      <p class="ptext">

        Add the botanical and essential oils together so they can bond or synergize. Then add the carrier oils (sesame and olive oil). Mix together and pour into in a pretty 4 or 5 oz, jar or bottle. Apply to your skin after a shower, before bedtime, or 10 minutes before you dress in the morning (so your skin absorbs the oils and not your clothes).
        <br>
        <br> This mixture lessens aging spots and blotchy skin colors, reduces wrinkles, increases collagen production for healthy skin and pores; it also tones and brightens skin.

          <span class="ptext-italic">(Would you rather we make this for you?  No problem!  We’ll make it for you.  8oz. bottle $24.50.)</span>
          <br>
          <br> For a delightful variation, put 3 T of this mixture in a bowl and add 2T of sea salt. Stand in the shower and massage this mixture into your skin. Enjoy the feel of rubbing it onto your body, freeing dead cells and stimulating new growth. Leave it on for several minutes so your body can absorb the nutritional benefits. Then shower as usual. When you step out of the shower, apply Winter Wonderful Blend to your skin and look in the mirror. The skin has that expensive spa shine. You will also love the feel of your smooth and silky skin!
          <br>
          <br> This recipe also benefits those with seborrhea, eczema, dermatitis, and severe dry, chapped skin. It contains excellent sources of Omega 3 &amp; 6, antioxidants, Vitamin A, C &amp; E, and emollients to retain moisture.
