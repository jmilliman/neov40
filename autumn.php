        <span class="ptext-bold">THE LARGE INTESTINE MERIDIAN - YANG</span>
        <br>
        <br> The Large Intestine meridian starts at the outside base of the pointer finger (1st finger) and moves up the ulna to the elbow, to the top of the shoulder and up to the outside base of the nostril.
        <br>
        <br>

        <span class="ptext-bold">Large Intestine foods:</span>&nbsp; juicing is wonderful and cleansing for the entire digestive tract, but you will often notice that people who juice regularly also have glowing skin. This is because they are cleansing the digestive tract, which also improves skin health. Healthy bacteria are necessary for digestive tract health. It aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy mucosa for the entire digestive tract; which keeps the waste moving: and in conjunction, keeps the lungs and skin breathing well.
        <br>
        <br> Dairy causes acne in many people, especially if one is purchasing milk from the grocery store that has antibiotics or hormones in the milk. Ultra-pasteurized organic milk has no life in it, so it does not support healthy bacteria in the digestive tract. Use unpasteurized cow or goat’s milk and probiotics, such as kefir, to feed a healthy digestive tract and clear skin.
        <br>
        <br> The Large Intestine Circadium rhythm is from 5:00 am – 7:00 am. This is the time of regeneration for the Large Intestine. It is particularly helpful to do exercises and direct healing energies to benefit the Large Intestine at this time.
